# Auspol19_twitter_TopicModelling
This repository contains the Auspol 2019 Twitter dataset as .CSV. Initally pulled from Kaggle as part of the Auspol sentiment analysis competition.

In this dataset I will be looking to clean, analyse, perform feature extraction and finally use Latent Derichlet Allocation as described by DM Blei, AY Ng, MI Jordan - Journal of machine Learning research, 2003 - jmlr.org.

The toolkits used will be Gensim/NLTK, as they are the easiest to use out of the box, but also provide very nice hyperparameter tuning capabilities.

I will update the ReadMe as I go through the project.
